Solving Differential Equation Synchronously
========================================================================


Evolved from [this artificial neural network algrimth](https://github.com/NeuPhysics/aNN). Regarding the generality of this method, a new repo is created here.

I learned the artificial neural network method from Shashank who is the postdoc in our group. And this is derived directly from that ANN method I learned.


The basic idea is to solve the equation without doing step by step integration numerically instead we find a proper parameterization and then find the parameters for the specific equation and initial condition or boundary condition.
